- [ ] Drop reqwest for finer graned control

### Goals
- [ ] Have a working prototype
- [ ] Working client implementation
- [ ] Working server implementation
- [ ] WebSockets support
- [ ] Wasm support
- [ ] Full rfc8620 conformance
- [ ] Full rfc8621 conformance
- [ ] Full rfc8887 conformance
- [ ] High level languages bindings (Deno, Node, Python, Java, etc..)
- [ ] Low level languages binding (C, C++, etc..)

### Nice to have
- [ ] Find an original name for the library
- [ ] Separate into different crates (monorepo?)
